With

	whois

such as 

	whois stg.io

Can get the information to see if the domain is registured.

If there is non found.

That means that no one has registured that domain and it can be bought.

So I will be looking for all the 5 letter combinations.

There are 26 letters in the alphabet.

No duplicates so for example:

	aaaaa

So to find the total:

	26 * 5

--

Actually what I need just the combination of 5 specific letters

Then look up each combination with whois
