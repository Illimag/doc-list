# WSL1 Upgrade WSL2

This is documentation on how to upgrade from WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) 1

to

WSL 2.

Firstly be part of the Windows insider program.

When the computer gets upgraded to the evalutation copy, it will finally allow you to run the commands to activate WSL .

To be part of the Windows insider program, sign up for the short ring and eventually the computer will be updated to the evalutation verison that allows for WSL2 upgrade.

Once you have activated WSL2, all that needs to be done is change the verison that the Windows Store Appplication is using and then it should complete.

For the exact commands you can search them online, but will need powershell with admin priveleges.
