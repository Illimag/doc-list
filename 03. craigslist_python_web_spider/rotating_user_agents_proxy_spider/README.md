# Rotating User Agents and Proxies Spider

This Spider uses rotating user agents and proxies.

Each time the spider does a http request it will sent the request with a header that has a randomized user agent.

Also with the proxy service it send the request from a different IP address each time.

It then outputs the data into .json format.

Many thanks to Storm Proxies, they have good service.
