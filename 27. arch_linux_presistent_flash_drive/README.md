# Arch Linux Presistent Flash Drive

The following instructions are how to make bootable Linux OS in a USB Flash Drive.

The Linux OS distro will be Arch Linux.

Having a Bootable OS from USB is a quick simple way to run a preferred OS from any machine, that you have boot access to.

AS well as having Presistent storage which means any data on the OS will be saved after shutdown.

Because of this we will want to have a OS that is light as well as a USB stick with a good amount of space.

## Live image

First we need two usb sticks.

The first usb stick will need to have arch linux already written on it.

To do this quickly just use a usb installer.

But note that no usb installer will be able to give options for presistent storage for Arch Linux.

## Link to wired (LAN)

Will need to be connected to LAN for now, because Arch Linux has additional setup requirements for wireless.

## BIOS vs UEFI

Don't worry about this unless there is an issue. 

## Secure boot

Here is a link to a signed boot logger
