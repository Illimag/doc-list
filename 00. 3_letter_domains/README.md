Are there any three letter domains left..

There are no more three letter .com domains left.

But I am also interested in the other extensions.

In particular the .io extension.

There will be a total of 17,576 possible combinations of ***.io domains.

With

	whois

such as 

	whois stg.io

Can get the information to see if the domain is registured.

If there is non found.

That means that no one has registured that domain and it can be bought.
